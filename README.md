# Movie-Recommendation-Engine-2-
The purpose of this recommendation engine is to recommend users some un-watched movies. If any unwatched movie got no rate, the rate will be put a median instead, because the median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of all rates.   The basic feature of the median in describing data is that it is not skewed by a small proportion of extremely large or small values, and therefore provides a better representation of a "typical" value.
